In his Tekken 5 interludes, he is shown treating his friends (such as Wang Jinrei and Steve Fox) with compassion and respect. For his enemies however, he attains a stern and direct approach to their arrest. Although his attempts can sometimes be clumsy, Lei's intentions are always virtuous in nature.",
