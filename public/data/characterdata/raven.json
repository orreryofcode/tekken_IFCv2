Nevertheless, the fighter appears to have a cold attitude and seems to take her mission seriously, as she says: \"Mission accomplished\" when winning a battle. Much like Raven before her, her true identity remains unknown and she uses a codename \"Master Raven\" suggesting that the name \"Raven\" is used as a class within the United Nations secret agent division to which they both belong.",
