In an attempt to to replicate this superhuman strength, the Mishima Zaibatsu started a genetic modification plan with the goal of replicating the effects of the gene on regular humans through the creation of a synthetic Devil Gene. One of the children in the program was known as Subject NT01, or Steve. ",
